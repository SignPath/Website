Trusted build systems provide additional security by adding another layer of authentication in form of a trusted build system token which should be set on the build agent only (or via a proxy service verifying e.g. SSL client certificates). The feature is currently in preview, please <a href='mailto:support@signpath.io?Subject=Trusted%20Build%20Systems'>contact us</a> for details.
